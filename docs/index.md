# What is SFTPGo?

SFTPGo is a managed, event-driven file transfer solution that abstracts storage backends and provides access to files through its built-in WebClient over HTTPS, as well as via standard SFTP, SCP, FTP/S, and WebDAV protocols.

With SFTPGo you can leverage local and cloud storage backends for exchanging and storing files internally or with business partners using the same tools and processes you are already familiar with.

The WebAdmin UI allows to easily create and manage your users, folders, groups and other resources.

The WebClient UI allows end users to change their credentials, browse and manage their files in the browser and setup two-factor authentication which works with Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator, Authy and other compatible apps.

SFTPGo in short:

- Event driven file transfer solution.
- Multiple protocols: SFTP, SCP, FTP/S, WebDAV, HTTP/S, REST API.
- Multiple storage backends: S3 Compatible, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob, other SFTP servers, local filesystem, encrypted local filesystem.
- Multiple data providers: SQLite, MySQL, PostresSQL, CockroachDB, Bolt and in-memory.
- Extensible via plugins and hooks.
- It works everywhere: on small embedded devices or large Kubernetes clusters. On Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD. On x86, arm, ppc64.
