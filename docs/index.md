# What is SFTPGo?

SFTPGo is an event-driven file transfer solution. It support multiple protocols (SFTP, SCP, FTP/S, WebDAV, HTTP/S) and multiple storage backends.

With SFTPGo you can leverage local and cloud storage backends for exchanging and storing files internally or with business partners using the same tools and processes you are already familiar with.

The WebAdmin UI allows to easily create and manage your users, folders, groups and other resources.

The WebClient UI allows end users to change their credentials, browse and manage their files in the browser and setup two-factor authentication which works with Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator, Authy and other compatible apps.

## Support

The open-source version of SFTPGo is free to use under the terms of its [license](#licensing). We are proud to provide a robust and fully functional edition that meets the needs of many production environments.

While we do not offer direct free support, community support is available. You can use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/discussions){:target="_blank"} to ask questions, share feedback and engage with other users of the project.

If you require guaranteed support, expert guidance, or advanced features, consider using SFTPGo Enterprise: a commercially licensed edition of SFTPGo that extends the open source version with enterprise-only features and full support. SFTPGo Enterprise can be deployed both on-premises and as a fully managed SaaS. For more information, please visit [sftpgo.com](https://sftpgo.com){:target="_blank"}.

SFTPGo is also offered as part of several paid services aiming to facilitate the installation and use of Open Source products or as part of paid software for self-hosted servers.
These services and software are not endorsed by, nor affiliated with, us. What you pay does not include our support for SFTPGo.

## Release Cadence

SFTPGo follows a feature-driven release cycle rather than a fixed, time-based schedule. Currently, our primary development efforts are focused on the [Enterprise edition](https://docs.sftpgo.com/enterprise/#enterprise-edition){:target="_blank"}, which benefits from a faster release cadence and receives major new features (see [changelog](https://docs.sftpgo.com/enterprise/changelog/){:target="_blank"}).

This open-source version of SFTPGo remains maintained and will continue to receive bug fixes and essential updates. However, not all enhancements introduced in the Enterprise edition will be available.

## Licensing

The [theme](https://keenthemes.com/products/templates-mega-bundle){:target="_blank"} used in WebAdmin and WebClient user interfaces is proprietary, this means:

- The SFTPGo WebAdmin and WebClient user interfaces (HTML, CSS and JS components) based on this theme are allowed for use only within the SFTPGo product and therefore cannot be used in derivative works/products without an explicit grant from the [SFTPGo Team](mailto:support@sftpgo.com).
