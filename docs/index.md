# What is SFTPGo?

SFTPGo is an event-driven file transfer solution. It support multiple protocols (SFTP, SCP, FTP/S, WebDAV, HTTP/S) and multiple storage backends.

With SFTPGo you can leverage local and cloud storage backends for exchanging and storing files internally or with business partners using the same tools and processes you are already familiar with.

The WebAdmin UI allows to easily create and manage your users, folders, groups and other resources.

The WebClient UI allows end users to change their credentials, browse and manage their files in the browser and setup two-factor authentication which works with Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator, Authy and other compatible apps.

## Support

We strongly believe in Open Source software model, so we decided to make SFTPGo available to everyone, but maintaining and evolving SFTPGo takes a lot of time and work. To make development and maintenance sustainable you should consider to support the project with a [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/drakkan){:target="_blank"}.

The open source license grant you freedom but not assurance of help. So why would you rely on free software without support or any guarantee it will stay healthy and maintained for the upcoming years?

We offer commercial support, guarantees, and advice for SFTPGo:

- With our [plans](https://sftpgo.com/plans){:target="_blank"} you can safely install and use SFTPGo on-premise in professional environments.
- With our [SaaS offerings](https://sftpgo.com/saas){:target="_blank"} you can use SFTPGo hosted in the cloud, fully managed and supported.
