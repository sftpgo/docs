# Installation

SFTPGo is compatible with Linux, Windows, macOS, and FreeBSD. Other BSD variants are likely to work as well, and the software can run on a wide range of systemsâ€”from small embedded devices to large-scale Kubernetes clusters.

The **Enterprise edition** is officially distributed and supported for Linux and Windows platforms, and is also available as a Docker image or through a Helm chart.

If you'd prefer to focus on your core business without worrying about the maintenance and security of your file transfer solution, consider opting for our fully managed [SaaS offerings](https://sftpgo.com/saas){:target="_blank"}. With a dedicated installation tailored specifically to your needs, you'll receive a secure, high-performance solution fully managed by us. We handle everything from security patches to upgrades, ensuring your service runs smoothly at all times.

:warning: **Note:** Only the installation methods explicitly documented here provide access to **SFTPGo Enterprise**.
Community distributions, including unofficial Docker images and pre-packaged solutions from third-party platforms, even if offered as paid services, provide the open-source edition of SFTPGo.
These versions **do not include Enterprise features** and are **not supported** by the SFTPGo team.

## Requirements

The only (optional) requirement is a suitable SQL server to use as data provider:

- upstream supported versions of PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB.
- CockroachDB stable.

You can remove this requirement by using an embedded SQLite, bolt or in memory data provider.

## Commercial Marketplaces

SFTPGo Enterprise is available on major cloud marketplaces, allowing you to quickly deploy pre-configured instances in your preferred environment. These offerings simplify installation and come with default settings, which can be easily adjusted to match your specific requirements.
