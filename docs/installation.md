# Installation

SFTPGo runs on small embedded devices or large Kubernetes clusters. On Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD. Other *BSD variants should work too.

If you'd prefer to focus on your core business without worrying about the maintenance and security of your file transfer solution, consider opting for our fully managed [SaaS offerings](https://sftpgo.com/saas){:target="_blank"}. With a dedicated installation tailored specifically to your needs, you'll receive a secure, high-performance solution fully managed by us, the authors of SFTPGo. We handle everything from security patches to upgrades, ensuring your service runs smoothly at all times.

## Requirements

The only (optional) requirement is a suitable SQL server to use as data provider:

- upstream supported versions of PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB.
- CockroachDB stable.

You can remove this requirement by using an embedded SQLite, bolt or in memory data provider.
