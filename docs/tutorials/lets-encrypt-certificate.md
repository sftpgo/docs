# Securing SFTPGo with a free Let's Encrypt TLS Certificate

This tutorial shows how to obtain and renew a free Let's encrypt TLS certificate for the SFTPGo Web UI and REST API, the WebDAV service and the FTP service.

Obtaining a Let's Encrypt certificate involves solving a domain validation challenge issued by an ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment) server. This challenge verifies your ownership of the domain(s) you're trying to obtain a certificate for. Different challenge types exist, the most commonly used being `HTTP-01`. As its name suggests, it uses the HTTP protocol. While HTTP servers can be configured to use any TCP port, this challenge will only work on port `80` due to security measures.

More info about the supported challenge types can be found [here](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/){:target="_blank"}.

There are several tools that allow you to obtain a Let's encrypt TLS certificate, in this tutorial we'll show how to use the [lego](https://github.com/go-acme/lego){:target="_blank"} CLI tool and the ACME protocol built into SFTPGo.

The `lego` CLI supports all the Let's encrypt challenge types.
The ACME protocol built into SFTPGo supports `HTTP-01` and `TLS-ALPN-01` challenge types.

In this tutorial we'll focus on `HTTP-01` challenge type and make the following assumptions:

- we are running SFTPGo on Linux
- we need a TLS certificate for the `sftpgo.com` domain
- we have an existing web server already running on port `80` for the `sftpgo.com` domain and the web root path is `/var/www/sftpgo.com`

## Obtaining a certificate using the Lego CLI tool

Download the latest [lego release](https://github.com/go-acme/lego/releases){:target="_blank"} and extract the lego binary in `/usr/local/bin`, then verify that it works.

```shell
lego -v
lego version 4.4.0 linux/amd64
```

We'll store the certificates in `/var/lib/lego` so create this directory.

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/lego
```

Now obtain a certificate. The HTTP based challenge will be created in a file in `/var/www/sftpgo.com/.well-known/acme-challenge`. This directory must be publicly served by your web server.

```shell
sudo lego --accept-tos --path="/var/lib/lego" --email="<you email address here>" --domains="sftpgo.com" --http.webroot="/var/www/sftpgo.com" --http run
```

You should be now able to list your certificate.

```shell
sudo lego --path="/var/lib/lego" list
Found the following certs:
  Certificate Name: sftpgo.com
    Domains: sftpgo.com
    Expiry Date: 2021-09-09 19:41:51 +0000 UTC
    Certificate Path: /var/lib/lego/certificates/sftpgo.com.crt
```

Now copy the certificate inside a private path to the SFTPGo service.

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/sftpgo/certs
sudo cp /var/lib/lego/certificates/sftpgo.com.{crt,key} /var/lib/sftpgo/certs
sudo chown -R sftpgo:sftpgo /var/lib/sftpgo/certs
```

### Automatic certificate renewal using the Lego CLI tool

SFTPGo can reload TLS certificates without service interruption, so we'll create a small bash script that copies the certificates inside the SFTPGo private directory and instructs SFTPGo to load them. We then configure `lego` to run this script when the certificates are renewed.

Create the file `/usr/local/bin/sftpgo_lego_hook` with the following contents.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

CERTS_DIR=/var/lib/sftpgo/certs
mkdir -p ${CERTS_DIR}

cp ${LEGO_CERT_PATH} ${LEGO_CERT_KEY_PATH} ${CERTS_DIR}

chown -R sftpgo:sftpgo ${CERTS_DIR}
systemctl reload sftpgo
```

Ensure that this script is executable.

```shell
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/sftpgo_lego_hook
```

Now create a daily cron job to check the certificate expiration and renew it if necessary. For example create the file `/etc/cron.daily/lego` with the following contents.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

lego --accept-tos --path="/var/lib/lego" --email="<you email address here>" --domains="sftpgo.com" --http-timeout 60 --http.webroot="/var/www/sftpgo.com" --http renew --renew-hook="/usr/local/bin/sftpgo_lego_hook"
```

Ensure that this cron script is executable.

```shell
sudo chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/lego
```

When the certificate is renewed you should see SFTPGo logs like the following to confirm that the new certificate was successfully loaded.

```json
{"level":"debug","time":"2021-06-14T20:05:15.785","sender":"service","message":"Received reload request"}
{"level":"debug","time":"2021-06-14T20:05:15.785","sender":"httpd","message":"TLS certificate \"/var/lib/sftpgo/certs/sftpgo.com.crt\" successfully loaded"}
{"level":"debug","time":"2021-06-14T20:05:15.785","sender":"ftpd","message":"TLS certificate \"/var/lib/sftpgo/certs/sftpgo.com.crt\" successfully loaded"}
{"level":"debug","time":"2021-06-14T20:05:15.786","sender":"webdavd","message":"TLS certificate \"/var/lib/sftpgo/certs/sftpgo.com.crt\" successfully loaded"}
```

## Obtaining a certificate using the ACME protocol built into SFTPGo

:warning: Starting from SFTPGo v2.5.0 you can also request certificates from the Server Manager -> Configurations -> ACME section of the WebAdmin UI.

You can open the SFTPGo configuration file, search for the `acme` section and change it as follow.

```json
  "acme": {
    "domains": ["sftpgo.com"],
    "email": "<you email address here>",
    "key_type": "4096",
    "certs_path": "/var/lib/sftpgo/certs",
    "ca_endpoint": "https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory",
    "renew_days": 30,
    "http01_challenge": {
      "port": 80,
      "proxy_header": "",
      "webroot": "/var/www/sftpgo.com"
    },
    "tls_alpn01_challenge": {
      "port": 0
    }
  }
```

Alternatively (recommended), you can use environment variables by creating the file `/etc/sftpgo/env.d/acme.env` with the following content.

```shell
SFTPGO_ACME__DOMAINS="sftpgo.com"
SFTPGO_ACME__EMAIL="<you email address here>"
SFTPGO_ACME__HTTP01_CHALLENGE__WEBROOT="/var/www/sftpgo.com"
```

Make sure that the `sftpgo` user can write to the `/var/www/sftpgo.com` directory or pre-create the `/var/www/sftpgo.com/.well-known/acme-challenge` directory with the appropriate permissions.
This directory must be publicly served by your web server.

:warning: in this example we assume you have an existing HTTP server. If not, you can leave the web root blank and SFTPGo will resolve the HTTP01 challenge by itself.

Register your account and obtain certificates by running the following command.

```bash
sudo -E su - sftpgo -m -s /bin/bash -c 'sftpgo acme run -c /etc/sftpgo'
```

If this command completes successfully, you are done. The SFTPGo service will take care of the automatic renewal of certificates for the configured domains. Make sure that the `sftpgo` system user can read and write to `/var/lib/sftpgo/certs` directory otherwise the certificate renewal will fail.

## Enable HTTPS for SFTPGo Web UI and REST API

You can open the SFTPGo configuration file, search for the `httpd` section and change it as follow.

```json
  "httpd": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "port": 9443,
        "address": "",
        "enable_web_admin": true,
        "enable_web_client": true,
        "enable_rest_api": true,
        "enable_https": true,
        "certificate_file": "/var/lib/sftpgo/certs/sftpgo.com.crt",
        "certificate_key_file": "/var/lib/sftpgo/certs/sftpgo.com.key",
        .....
```

Alternatively (recommended), you can use environment variables by creating the file `/etc/sftpgo/env.d/httpd.env` with the following content.

```shell
SFTPGO_HTTPD__BINDINGS__0__PORT=9443
SFTPGO_HTTPD__BINDINGS__0__ENABLE_HTTPS=1
SFTPGO_HTTPD__BINDINGS__0__CERTIFICATE_FILE="/var/lib/sftpgo/certs/sftpgo.com.crt"
SFTPGO_HTTPD__BINDINGS__0__CERTIFICATE_KEY_FILE="/var/lib/sftpgo/certs/sftpgo.com.key"
```

Restart SFTPGo to apply the changes. The HTTPS service is now available on port `9443`.

## Enable HTTPS for WebDAV service

You can open the SFTPGo configuration file, search for the `webdavd` section and change it as follow.

```json
  "webdavd": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "port": 10443,
        "address": "",
        "enable_https": true,
        "certificate_file": "/var/lib/sftpgo/certs/sftpgo.com.crt",
        "certificate_key_file": "/var/lib/sftpgo/certs/sftpgo.com.key",
        ...
```

Alternatively (recommended), you can use environment variables by creating the file `/etc/sftpgo/env.d/webdavd.env` with the following content.

```shell
SFTPGO_WEBDAVD__BINDINGS__0__PORT=10443
SFTPGO_WEBDAVD__BINDINGS__0__ENABLE_HTTPS=1
SFTPGO_WEBDAVD__CERTIFICATE_FILE="/var/lib/sftpgo/certs/sftpgo.com.crt"
SFTPGO_WEBDAVD__CERTIFICATE_KEY_FILE="/var/lib/sftpgo/certs/sftpgo.com.key"
```

Restart SFTPGo to apply the changes. WebDAV is now availble over HTTPS on port `10443`.

## Enable explicit FTP over TLS

You can open the SFTPGo configuration file, search for the `ftpd` section and change it as follow.

```json
  "ftpd": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "port": 2121,
        "address": "",
        "apply_proxy_config": true,
        "tls_mode": 1,
        "certificate_file": "/var/lib/sftpgo/certs/sftpgo.com.crt",
        "certificate_key_file": "/var/lib/sftpgo/certs/sftpgo.com.key",
        ...
```

Alternatively (recommended), you can use environment variables by creating the file `/etc/sftpgo/env.d/ftpd.env` with the following content.

```shell
SFTPGO_FTPD__BINDINGS__0__PORT=2121
SFTPGO_FTPD__BINDINGS__0__TLS_MODE=1
SFTPGO_FTPD__BINDINGS__0__CERTIFICATE_FILE="/var/lib/sftpgo/certs/sftpgo.com.crt"
SFTPGO_FTPD__BINDINGS__0__CERTIFICATE_KEY_FILE="/var/lib/sftpgo/certs/sftpgo.com.key"
```

Restart SFTPGo to apply the changes. FTPES service is now available on port `2121` and TLS is required for both control and data connection (`tls_mode` is 1).
